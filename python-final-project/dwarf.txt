DWARF

Short, taciturn, and materialistic, dwarves make their dwellings beneath hilly and mountainous regions. Their greatest loves in life are strong drink, valuable metals, and precious gems. They are not well-suited to riding or magic, but their talent in fighting, craftsmanship, and engineering can be invaluable to a party.
