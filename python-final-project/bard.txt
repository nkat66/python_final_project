BARD

Spinners of stories and lovers of fanciful tales. Bards are less suspicious than their distant cousins, the thieves; they are less concerned with what's in the pockets of richer folk and more interested with the history, lore, and tales that come from a good book or a talented storyteller. They tend to be glib, charismatic, and lighthearted, making their way through the world through wit and a good song or two.
