PALADIN

A symbol of righteousness and virtue, paladins are noble and heroic figures who serve as a symbol of justice and truth to the masses. As such, they must maintain high ideals, along with an adherence to lawfulness and good deeds. Though powerful warriors, this ideal is hard to maintain; a warrior who knowingly commits an evil act loses their powers permanently, while those who perform evil or chaotic acts unwittingly under the influence of a spell must seek out and perform some dangerous penance to regain their powers. However, those who are able to hold fast to the high standards held by this class find themselves armed with powerful abilities indeed.
