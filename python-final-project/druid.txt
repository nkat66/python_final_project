DRUID

Priests who tend to nature and act as its stewards and guardians; rather than placing their faith in an ethereal, distant deity, they worship the spirits and gods who govern the very earth their feet stand upon. They shun metal armor, and use only leather armors, wooden shields, and magical items to guard themselves. Their focus and task for their time on this earth consists of continuing the natural cycles of death and rebirth in a sustainable and balanced fashion.
