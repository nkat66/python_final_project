RANGER

Huntsmen who live by the sword and their wits. As skilled woodsmen, they make excellent trackers and and animal handlers. They may wear any weapon and use any armor they wish, but must keep in mind that some of their special abilities can only be used when wearing light or leather armor. Rangers can be of any good alignment, be it Lawful, Chaotic, or Good - after all, even if it is their nature to do good, it is not always done by the rules.
